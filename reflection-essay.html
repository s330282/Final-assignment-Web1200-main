                    Transitioning from upper-secondary to university

                    A pupil refers to a young learner, usually those who are in secondary school and below, while a student refers to learners who are enrolled in a college or university. Pupils are those learners who are below 18 years old while students are those learners who are above 18 years old. In this essay we are going to reflect about the challenges we faced when we became students.

                    There are both cons and pros to being a student. Many students may like being a student. For others it might become a big challenge. It depends in how hard the person used to work alone in high school. The harder they work the easier it becomes for them. 

                    One of the pros of being students is that you get to manage your time on your own. You don’t have to wake up in the morning sometimes if you don’t have any mandatory classes. Students gets to choose when they want to study. Some people like studying at night some people like to wake up early in the morning and do what they need to do early in the morning.

                    Another pro of being student is that you can save time. You can take the break you want whenever you want, and you can work as faster as you can or as slower as you want. You don’t have to meet your classmates every day. You can meet your friends anytime you want to meet them. So, you have all the time for yourself and that is what some of us needed. We don’t want to be trapped with the school’s plan for us.

                      On the other hand, we have some cons to being a student. you are a pupil then you don’t have to summarize or try to find out what is necessary for your course. That doesn’t necessary mean that you don’t have any guidance when you are a student, but you always must ask to something. But some teachers at high school tells you do this and that. And you don’t need to do this. That way they make it easy for you to study.

                      When people go to high school their plan is made and they cannot do anything about it. For instance, if you are good at something or if you already know what the others don’t know that means you don’t have a choice and you must sit and listen with the rest of the students. That means you are not allowed to use your time to other tasks or anything else you wanted to do. Maybe use your phone because you know what the teacher is talking about.
